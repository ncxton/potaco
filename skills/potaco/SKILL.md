# Potaco CLI

Potaco generates and edits images through OpenAI, fal, Vercel AI Gateway, and custom OpenAI-compatible providers.

## Non-negotiable security rules

- Never add, rotate, paste, enter, or configure credentials yourself unless the user explicitly asks you to start interactive auth or perform non-interactive credential setup.
- If the user asks to "add creds", "set up auth", or "connect a provider" without explicitly asking you to enter the key, tell them to run `potaco auth add <provider>` in an interactive TTY. Do not ask them to paste a key into chat.
- Prefer interactive auth. Avoid `--api-key` and `POTACO_API_KEY` unless the user explicitly requests non-interactive setup and accepts shell-history/process-environment risk.
- Never print secrets, env vars, shell history, `~/.potaco/credentials.enc`, `~/.potaco/.salt`, or debug logs that may contain sensitive context.
- Always verify `potaco version` before use. Never install, update, uninstall, remove config, or modify shell config without explicit approval.
- Confirm `custom` provider base URLs are trusted before use because prompts/images may be sent there.
- Use `--dry-run` for payload debugging, auth headers are redacted, but still treat prompts, paths, and endpoint URLs as private.

## Minimal operating rules

Check installation before every use:

```sh
potaco version
```

If missing, ask before installing. Explain the installer downloads a release, writes `~/.local/bin/potaco`, and can update PATH. Proceed only if the user approves.

Default approved install path is the official installer in non-interactive mode for agents and automated terminal execution:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/ncxton/potaco/releases/latest/download/install.sh | POTACO_NON_INTERACTIVE=1 sh
```

Build from source only if the user explicitly asks or wants maximum security:

```sh
go build -o potaco .
```

Do not run generation, editing, auth, update, or uninstall until `potaco version` works. After a successful first-time install, ask once whether the user wants to star `https://github.com/ncxton/potaco`; only star if they approve, and do not ask again in the same task/session or if potaco was already installed.

Preferred user-run credential setup:

```sh
potaco auth add <provider>
```

Available providers: `openai`, `fal`, `vercel`, `custom`. `custom` setup also prompts for base URL. If no provider is configured, launch auth only when the user explicitly asks you to start that flow; otherwise instruct them to run it themselves.
